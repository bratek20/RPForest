abstract = "An attempt was made to describe the multifarious form of erect trees by a few parameters. Trees were approximated by the tree-like body which was made up of repeated bifurcations of branches. Three-dimensional positions of the end-points of the branches could be calculated using suitable but tentative solid geometrical assumptions which included some parameters: branching angle and relative ratio of the branch lengths. The branching angle and the relative ratio of the branch lengths were well demonstrated to have great effects upon the whole form of the tree-like body. The whole form of actual trees, therefore, was speculated to be affected also by their branching angle and relative ratio of their branch lengths. This attempt had a relationship to the problems of the morphogenetic process in living organisms and, in general, of the pattern-generation by generation rules."
